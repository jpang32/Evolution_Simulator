As of 1/4/2022:

- On change_activation branch, the activation function is now tanh between both layers. However,
this seems to cause one out of the 4 outputs to continue to be dominant over the other ones.
For example, microbes that move to the right will survive, and the gene pool gets better at
reaching the safe zone, but they will continue to only move right in the next generation and
won't ever move down. Trying to find a way to change it so that their actions are not so
determinant (maybe by keeping these tanh activations and changing the outputs to a probability?)

Other possible improvements:
- Make it so that the user can skip over a certain number of generations so that they don't
have to watch each one play. One problem is that the generations take just as long to run if
we don't play the visual. (Could this be solved somehow by running things in parallel?)
- Giving the user the option to pause after every generation, and be able to continue to
the next by pressing 'k'. This could be done with the above, by allowing users to either press
k or entering a number (of generations to skip).
- Making the textbox more detailed
- Typing everything
- Adding more types of Organisms
- Adding more inputs / outputs
- Fixing the fact that weights which connect input nodes to input nodes are simply ignored
as of now
- Add things like food, killing / eating each other, releasing pheromones
- Making breeding more complex (Adding probability that two Microbes breed, maybe based on
how much Microbes are compatible (have similar genes? certain characteristics?))
